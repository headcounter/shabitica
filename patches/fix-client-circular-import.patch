    client: Fix circular import in statsComputed
    
    This happens in spells.js, which imports statsComputed. The latter
    imports content/index, which in turn imports spells.js.
    
    However, the only thing that is needed by statsComputed is content/gear,
    which we can also import directly because it's not altered in any way in
    content/index.
